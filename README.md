Forecasting COVID-19 Time Series Using the ARIMA Model:-

The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model will be used in this study to anticipate the future distribution of COVID-19 instances. The ARIMA model is a well-known time series forecasting tool that may detect patterns and trends in time series data. We may obtain estimates for future case counts by applying the ARIMA model to previous COVID-19 data, offering valuable insights for decision-making and resource allocation.


Usage-

1. Create a clone of the repository by accessing the notebook through the link provided below:
https://shorturl.at/xzPST

2.To upload the csv file click on upload to session storage icon in Colab and select the covid_19_data.csv file and upload it .Then under the file location mention the path:"/content/covid_19_data.csv"  or if this doesnâ€™t work then use the path "Covid_19_data.csv"

3. Run the code step-by-step by opening the Jupyter notebooks/Google Colab notebook. Modify the notebooks to meet your individual dataset or analysis needs.

4. Use the included notebooks to train the ARIMA model. Make any necessary changes to the model parameters and validate the model's performance.

5. Once trained and validated, our model is ready. 


FAQs-

Q: What is the goal of this project?

A: The ARIMA model will be used to anticipate the future spread of COVID-19 cases in this research. We can generate estimates for future case counts by analyzing historical data and applying time series forecasting techniques, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively.

Q: What exactly is ARIMA?

A: ARIMA is an acronym that stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a popular time series forecasting model that uses a combination of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and differencing (I) components to detect patterns and trends in sequential data.

Q: How does the ARIMA model work in this project?

A: The ARIMA model examines past COVID-19 case counts to identify patterns. These patterns are then used to anticipate future case counts. To provide reliable forecasts, the model considers elements such as seasonality, trend, and noise in the data.

Q: What is the data required for this project?

A: The project requires previous COVID-19 case count data as well as any other relevant variables for modeling. A time series of cases should be included in the dataset, preferably with dates or timestamps connected with each data point.

Q: Where do I get the COVID-19 dataset for this project?

A: We obtained the necessary dataset from Kaggle, however there are multiple additional trustworthy sources of COVID-19 data accessible, including government health departments, research organizations, and public health websites. You can also get the dataset from these places.  

Q: Which programming language is employed in this project?

A: Python, a prominent programming language for data analysis and machine learning, is used to create this project. Python has a number of libraries for data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization, including Pandas, NumPy, and StatsModels.

Q: Is there a tutorial available that explains the complete project?

A: Yes, we have created a video tutorial, the link to which is provided below. You can view the video file to learn more about the project and its applications.

Q: Can I customize the model or use a different forecasting method?

A: This project serves as a starting point for forecasting COVID-19 time series using the ARIMA model. Based on your individual needs and experience, you can modify the model, experiment with other parameters, and even investigate alternative forecasting methodologies.
